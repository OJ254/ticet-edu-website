              A Note from Ticet EDU's CEO
            </h5>
            <p class="p-small mb-6">
              At Ticet EDU, our commitment to Environmental, Social, and
              Governance (ESG) values is not just a priority; it’s part of our
              foundation. As an alumnus of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, I have
              learned the impact of sustainable and responsible business, and
              I’m proud to bring this approach to Ticet EDU. Our goal is to
              empower communities, create inclusive learning opportunities, and
              ensure transparency in every aspect of our operations.
            </p>
            <p class="p-small mb-6">
              Through our Community Library, the first of many innovations,
              we’ve created a platform rooted in collaboration and
              accessibility. While Ticet EDU is subscription-based, our sharing
              economy model lowers costs for learners by enabling educators to
              create both premium and communal resources. Verified content
              creators benefit from active income from paid libraries or passive
              income from revenue-sharing on public libraries. This approach
              ensures that users can access a wide range of quality educational
              resources at affordable rates, fostering a supportive ecosystem
              where all members benefit.
            </p>
            <p class="p-small mb-6">
              Environmental stewardship is also central to our journey. We’re
              mindful of reducing our carbon footprint, utilizing sustainable
              digital practices, and minimizing waste in all operations. Our
              vision for the future includes supporting green technologies as we
              grow.
            </p>
            <p class="p-small">
              Transparency and accountability are at the core of our governance
              practices. By establishing clear and ethical policies, we ensure
              trust among our users, partners, and stakeholders, fostering a
              supportive and resilient community. Together, we can build an
              ed-tech platform that positively impacts lives, society, and the
              planet.
